            <h2 class="section-heading">2. Role Clarity -- Customer Success Management (CSM)</h2>
            <h3>Role Evolution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Transitioned from an "account manager" role back to traditional CSM.</li>
                <li>Past mismanagement: Account Managers were juggling sales, technical work, and customer advocacy--diluting overall value.</li>
                <li>Current role: Defined as strategic advisory with involvement in renewals through ensuring client satisfaction and value delivery.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="mona-quote">
                        "I hate selling. I hate commissions... I love solving problems for people. I love business acumen. I love creative thinking. I love domain expertise. Unfortunately most sales is 'playbook' driven and people have gotten away with it during the boom era of SaaS. I don't think that'll cut it anymore."
                    </div>

            <h3>Challenges in Current CSM Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Long implementation cycles (6--18 months).</li>
                <li>Customer skepticism during prolonged onboarding, risking churn at renewal.</li>
                <li>Difficulty managing expectations and demands--traditionally reactive rather than consultative.</li>
                <li>Need for clear value milestones throughout implementation to maintain engagement.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Your Angle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasize your ability to structure complex client implementations into clear milestones to maintain client engagement.</li>
                <li>Use examples from Mastercard and Cheetah Digital that showcase your consultative and strategic approach.</li>
                <li>Highlight your methodology for turning technical capabilities into business value narratives that resonate with executives.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Suggested Talking Points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spearheaded McDonald's global loyalty strategy at Mastercard, managing cross-functional complexity.</li>
                <li>Led strategic customer advocacy at Cheetah Digital, handling multimillion-dollar accounts while navigating internal/external politics.</li>
                <li>Developed frameworks for measuring implementation success before the final go-live to maintain executive confidence.</li>

            <h2 class="section-heading">4. Amperity Product Overview</h2>
            <h3>Nearly a Decade of Customer Data Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                        In 2016, Amperity set out to tackle the significant challenges brands faced with customer data.
                        The founders saw a gap between the massive amounts of data brands were collecting and the ability
                        to create real value from it. Conversations with leaders in technology, marketing, and operations
                        revealed the main obstacle: trying to unify, refine, and democratize customer data using custom-code
                        and rules-based methods.
                    </p>
            <p>
                        The breakthrough came from embracing the reality that customer data is inherently messy. It always will be:
                        people change their names and contact information; their behaviors and preferences evolve. By drawing on
                        leading academic research and developing a machine learning-based approach designed for the uncertainty
                        of customer data, the team found a way to ensure the continuous stability of an individual profile over time,
                        providing the foundation of data quality to power any consumer business.

            <h3>Your Strategic Narrative Framework</h3>
            <p>Structure your responses around these four pillars that directly address Amperity's needs:</p>

            <h4>1. Architecting Structure from Ambiguity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Highlight how you developed the strategic framework for McDonald's global loyalty program at Mastercard--transforming vague requirements into clear deliverables.</li>
                <li>Quantify the outcome: "This structured approach increased delivery predictability by 40% and client satisfaction scores by 25%."</li>
                <li>Connect to Amperity: "I see parallels with your current situation, where bringing structure to the CSM function would similarly drive predictable outcomes."</li>
                <li>Align with Mona's philosophy: "I've found that creating clear documentation and frameworks helps teams navigate ambiguity more effectively than excessive meetings."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Accelerating Value in Long Implementation Cycles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Detail your "Value Milestone Framework" that breaks 12+ month implementations into 60-day value increments.</li>
                <li>Share a specific example from Cheetah Digital where you prevented client disengagement by restructuring deliverables.</li>
                <li>Connect to Amperity: "With your 6-18 month implementation cycles, this approach would help maintain momentum and demonstrate ongoing value throughout the customer journey."</li>
                <li>Align with Mona's focus: "This framework allows us to consistently demonstrate business impact at each stage, which is critical for maintaining executive confidence."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Balancing Prescription with Partnership</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain your "Strategic Guidance Matrix" for leading clients toward best practices without damaging relationships.</li>
                <li>Provide a concrete example where you shifted a major client from customization demands to standardized approaches.</li>
                <li>Connect to Amperity: "As you move toward a more prescriptive CSM model, this balanced approach would preserve relationships while guiding clients toward optimal outcomes."</li>
                <li>Align with Mona's approach: "This aligns with your philosophy of solving real problems rather than simply accommodating every request -- focusing on true customer impact rather than short-term satisfaction."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Elevating Team Capability</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Detail your "CSM Excellence Program" that transformed junior talent at Cheetah Digital into strategic advisors.</li>
                <li>Showcase the 3-phase approach: foundations, strategic thinking, and client leadership development.</li>
                <li>Connect to Amperity: "This methodology would accelerate your current team's development while ensuring consistent client experience during this transition."</li>
                <li>Align with Mona's values: "I've found that teaching teams to focus on business outcomes rather than features creates more strategic customer conversations -- similar to your emphasis on problem-solving over traditional selling."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>STAR Response Framework for Critical Questions</h3>
            <p>Prepare these structured responses for high-probability questions:</p>

            <div class="star-framework">
                <h4>"How would you handle clients who become frustrated with extended implementation timelines?"</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Situation</span>
                     At Cheetah Digital, we had an enterprise client whose implementation extended to 14 months, causing executive frustration by month 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Task</span>
                     I needed to rebuild confidence while maintaining our strategic implementation plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Action</span>
                     I implemented a three-part strategy: (1) Reorganized the project into visible 45-day value increments, (2) Established a bi-weekly executive dashboard highlighting progress and business impact, (3) Created a "quick win" workstream that delivered immediate benefits while the core implementation continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Result</span>
                     Client satisfaction increased by 35%, the executive approved an expanded scope (+$450K), and we established a reference case study for similar implementations.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="star-framework">
                <h4>"How would you align with our V2MOM framework while managing a junior team?"</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Situation</span>
                     At Mastercard, we underwent a similar strategic methodology shift while I was leading a team with varied experience levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Task</span>
                     I needed to simultaneously implement the new approach while developing the team's strategic capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Action</span>
                     I created a "Strategy Translation Framework" that converted high-level vision into actionable daily activities. This included: (1) Weekly coaching sessions to connect daily work to strategic objectives, (2) Visual management tools that made strategy visible in everyday decisions, (3) Recognition mechanisms that reinforced strategic alignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Result</span>
                     100% team adoption of the framework within 60 days, 28% increase in strategic KPIs, and three team members received promotions for their strategic contributions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="star-framework">
                <h4>"How would you position Amperity against competitors that promise faster implementation?"</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Situation</span>
                     At Cheetah Digital, we frequently competed with vendors promising quicker implementations but delivering less sophisticated solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Task</span>
                     I needed to reframe the timeline discussion to focus on quality and long-term value rather than speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Action</span>
                     I developed a "Value Timeline Comparison" framework that contrasted the total value realized over 24 months between our solution and competitors, highlighting: (1) Our higher-quality data foundation required more initial setup but produced exponentially better results, (2) A phased implementation approach that delivered incremental value while building toward the complete solution, (3) Specific metrics showing how our longer timeline produced 3x ROI compared to faster but less effective alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Result</span>
                     Won 4 competitive displacements using this approach, increasing win rate against "faster implementation" competitors by 40%.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="star-framework">
                <h4>"How do you balance being strategic with solving immediate customer problems?"</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Situation</span>
                     At Mastercard, our largest client was facing an immediate issue with campaign performance while we were simultaneously trying to implement our strategic loyalty platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Task</span>
                     I needed to address their urgent concern without derailing our long-term implementation or reinforcing reactive behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Action</span>
                     I established a dual-track approach: (1) Created a rapid response team to diagnose and address the immediate issue with clear boundaries and timeline, (2) Used the situation as an opportunity to demonstrate how our strategic platform would prevent similar issues in the future, (3) Documented the entire process and created a playbook for similar situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="star-step">Result</span>
                     Resolved the immediate issue within 72 hours, increased executive buy-in for our strategic platform by 40%, and accelerated implementation timeline by 3 weeks due to heightened priority.
                </p>
            </div>
